# x-vector_pytorch

## ATTENTION!!!

This repository will not be updated because I found the implementation is quite naive as a PyTorch project.

Thanks for paying attention to this repository but the code of this repository is little valuable.

Anyone who want to try x-vector you can run the scripts of kaldi egs, the path in kaldi in kaldi/egs/voxceleb/v2.

If you want to try python implementation of x-vector, you can find valuable code in SIDEKIT whose version is 1.3.2.
